ReactShoot!
=======================

This repo shows the possibility of writing a React app with Flux, Browserify, Firebase, React-Router, and Gulp. The app allows users to play multiplayer online game against other players. If nobody else was connected, the best solution would be to open the game in another tab and see what it can do by yourself.

You can play the game here: http://www.singlepagefun.com/reactshoot/
